Scrabble
--------

* Calculate the score for a word (you may ignore double/triple letter/word scores).
* Assign seven tiles chosen randomly from the english alphabet to a rack.
* Letters should be distributed based on the English [Scrabble letter distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrabble_letter_distributions) (you may ignore blank tiles).
* Find a valid word formed from the seven tiles. A list of valid words can be found in `twl06.txt`.
* Find the longest valid word that can be formed from the seven tiles.
* Find the highest scoring word that can be formed.
* Find the highest scoring word if any one of the letters can score triple.
* For discussion: how would we adapt our solution for a multiplayer environment?
